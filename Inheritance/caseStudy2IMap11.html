    Inefficiencies

  <div>
    <p>
      The predefined <code>AbstractMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code> base class
      made it a lot easier to implement an
      <code>Imap&lt;K,V&gt;</code> interface that inherits all of the
      methods listed in
      <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code>, but we paid a price in efficiency.
</p>
    <p>
      All of the operations we inherit from
      <code>AbstractMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code> are implemented in that
      class by calling the abstract
      <code>entrySet</code> method we defined in our
      <code>AListIMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code> subclass.
</p>
    <p>
      That means all of the inherited methods have to create and initialize
      a new object of the <code>HashMap</code> class.
      That takes &Omega;(n<sup>2</sup>) time,
      where n is the number of key/value pairs in the <code>IMap</code>.
</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We have to create an entry for each of the n key/value pairs,
        and the average time to look up each value is
        &Theta;(n)
        because we're using association lists.
</p>
</blockquote>
    <p>
      We could make at least some of the inherited methods run
      faster by overriding them in our <code>AListIMap</code>.
</p>
    <p>
      We could, for example, implement the
      <code>contains</code> and <code>lookup</code> methods
      by forwarding to the corresponding methods of the
      association list found in <code>this.alist</code>.
      That would make those important methods run a lot faster.
</p>
    <p>
      Implementing all of the other new methods from scratch
      could be a lot of work.
      If we're going to do that much work, we might as well try
      to use a potentially more efficient representation
      while we're at it.
</p>
    <p>
      We could use binary search trees instead of association lists.
      Better yet, we could use
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree"
         target="_blank">red-black trees</a>.
      We'll leave that for a programming assignment,
      or for your algorithms course.
