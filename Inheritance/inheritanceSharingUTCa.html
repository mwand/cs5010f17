  <h3>
    The <code>UTC</code> Example
</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      In the
      <a href="../InterfacesClasses/staticMethods1.html">
        previous lesson,
</a>
      we defined a class <code>UTC2</code> that inherits
      several of its methods from another class <code>UTC1</code>.
</p>
    <p>
      That use of inheritance was inelegant and somewhat fragile.
      Why does <code>UTC2</code> inherit from <code>UTC1</code>
      instead of the other way around?
      What if some future programmer modifies <code>UTC1</code>
      without realizing the modified behavior will be
      inherited by other classes such as <code>UTC2</code>?
</p>
    <p>
      It would be more symmetrical, more elegant, and less fragile
      to define an <em>abstract base class</em> in which we implement
      the common behavior.
      Classes <code>UTC1</code> and <code>UTC2</code>
      would both inherit from that common base class.
      The behaviors of the <em>concrete subclasses</em>
      <code>UTC1</code> and <code>UTC2</code>
      would no longer be affected by changes to other concrete subclasses
      of the abstract base class.
</p>
    <p>
      The abstract base class will consist of field and method definitions
      in which we implement the common behavior.
      The abstract base class will also contain declarations of
      <em>abstract methods</em>
      that are not defined in the base class because they will have
      differing behavior in the various subclasses.
</p>
    <p>
      Declaring an abstract method in the base class means
      every (non-abstract) class that inherits from the base class
      must provide a definition for the method.
      We say the base class is abstract because some of its methods
      are abstract (declared but not defined), so we cannot create
      objects of the base class.
