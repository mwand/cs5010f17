  <h3>
    Determining the Set of Defined Keys
</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The operations specified so far would be enough for some
      applications of finite functions,
      but those operations do not give users any practical way
      to learn which keys lie within the domain of a
      particular finite function.
</p>
    <p>
      We could define a <code>keySet</code> operation
      that returns the set
      of keys on which a finite function is defined,
      and we could use an algebraic specification to specify that set:
</p>
    <pre>
      // If empty_alist is a representation of the empty alist, then
      //     empty_alist.keySet() = { }
      //
      // If a is any alist, then
      //     a.extend(k1,v1).keySet() = { k1 } &cup; a.keySet()
</pre>
    <p>
      That <code>keySet</code> operation would work just fine,
      and it ought to be perfectly straightforward to implement,
      but it isn't as easy to implement as it should be because
      Java's standard libraries offer very little support
      for immutable sets (and other immutable data structures).
      We'd have to design and implement an abstract data type
      of immutable sets before we could return to designing our
      abstract data type of immutable finite functions.
</p>
    <p>
      To avoid that digression, we'll do something completely different.
