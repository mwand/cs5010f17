  <h3>
    How Inheritance Works
</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Searching an inheritance chain may sound slow,
      but implementations of OO languages use a variety of
      clever tricks to make that search run quite fast.
</p>
    <p>
      In a method call such as
      <code>x.f(3,4)</code>,
      some details of that search depend upon whether
      the type of <code>x</code>
      is an interface type or a class type.
      The details are a little simpler for a class type,
      as when <code>x</code> is <code>this</code>,
      so we consider that case first.
</p>
    <p>
      A Java compiler can
      arrange all of the methods defined or inherited by a class into
      a linear sequence called the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual
      method table</a>.
      When the type of <code>x</code> is a class type,
      the compiler can use that type
      to figure out what the virtual method table for <code>x</code>
      will look like, and then searches that table
      <em>at compile time</em> to find the unique entry
      for a method named <code>f</code> that takes two arguments,
      both of type <code>int</code>.
      The compiler generally cannot determine which version of
      <code>f</code> will be present in that entry at run time,
      because that depends on the class of <code>x</code>, which
      may be different from the type of <code>x</code>,
      but the compiler can compute the <em>index</em> of that entry
      at compile time.
</p>
    <p>
      The compiler then generates machine code that, at run time,
      will obtain the virtual method table for <code>x</code>,
      use the index computed at compile time to fetch a pointer
      to the code for the <code>f(int,int)</code> method
      of <code>x</code>, and jump to that code.
</p>
    <p>
      The machine code for <code>x.f(3,4)</code> will look
      something like this:
</p>
    <pre>
      load    24(sp),r0     ; evaluate x into register r0
      loadi   3,r1          ; evaluate 3 into register r1
      loadi   4,r2          ; evaluate 4 into register r2
      load    8(r0),r3      ; fetch virtual method table
      load    368(r3),r3    ; fetch pointer to code for f
      jmp     (r3)          ; jump to code for f
</pre>
    <p>
      That sequence of code should run very quickly.
</p>
    <p>
      Note that the value of <code>x</code> is passed in
      register <code>r0</code>, which becomes the home of
      <code>this</code> within the machine code for
      <code>f</code>.
</p>
    <p>
      The virtual method table may be fairly large, as
      suggested by the 368 in that example, but all objects
      of the same class will share the same virtual method
      table.
</p>
    <p>
      Objects of different classes will have different
      virtual method tables, which is what allows methods
      to be overridden by subclasses.
