<h1>Design Recipe Deliverables</h1>




<h3>Here are the items you need to include for each question:
</h3>


<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>For Each Data Definition:</Strong>
  <p/>

  <ol>
    <li>A set of <kbd>struct</kbd> definitions, if necessary.</li>
    
    <li>A <em>constructor template</em> that specifies how to build
    values for this data definition.</li> 

    <li>An <em>interpretation</em>, explaining
    the meaning of each element in the data in terms of the information it
    represents.  The meaning should be the meaning of the data, not of
    how it used in the program.
    </li>

    <li>An <em>observer template</em> for examining values of this kind of
    data.</li>

    <li>Examples if they will be helpful in understanding the
    interpretation, or for use in tests.  If the examples are
    primarily for use in tests, you may put them near the tests.
    </li>
    
  </ol>
  <p/>
</li>

  <li><strong>For Each Function:</strong>
  <p/>

  <ol>
    
    <li>Contract: a specification of data definitions for the
    arguments and the result.  If you write

    <pre>
    list-numbered : ListOfNumber Number -> ListOfNumber
</pre>

    then your function must take <em>any</em> list of numbers and
    <em>any</em> number and produce the output that is described by
    the purpose statement, unless the contract is qualified by an
    invariant (WHERE-clause).  We will talk about WHERE-clauses in
    module 7.

</li>

    <a name="purpose-statement">
    <li>Purpose Statement:</li> A short noun phrase describing
    <em>what</em> the function is supposed to return. Typically
    phrased in terms of information, not data.  Generally takes the
    form GIVEN/WHERE/RETURNS, where each of these keywords is followed
    by a short noun phrase.  Examples:

    <pre>
    GIVEN: a temperature in Fahrenheit
    RETURNS: the corresponding temperature in Celsius

    GIVEN: a Cat c and a Scene s
    RETURNS: A scene like s, except that the cat c has been painted on it.

    GIVEN: a list of numbers lon and a number n
    WHERE: n = (length lon)
    RETURNS: a list of numbers like lon, except that each number is
    multiplied by its distance from the end of the list.
    </pre>

    <p>You may omit the GIVEN clause by referring to the givens in the
    RETURNS clause. Sometimes this is easier than writing a GIVENS
    clause, sometimes it is harder.  Examples:

     <pre>
    RETURNS: the temperature in Celsius that corresponds to the given
    Fahrenheit temperature.

    RETURNS: A scene like the given one, except that the given cat has
    been painted on it.
    </pre>

</p>

    <li>Examples.  The examples should illustrate the different
    behaviors of the function.</li>

    <li>Halting Measure.  For every function that calls itself either
    directly or indirectly, you must include a halting measure, which
    is a non-negative integer quantity that must decrease at every
    recursive call. You should be prepared to defend your choice of
    halting measure at your codewalk.  Halting measures are discussed
    in more detail beginning in Module 05.</li>

    <li>Design Strategy: A short description of how to get from the
    purpose statement to the function definition.  These will
    typically be one of the following phrases:
    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine simpler functions </li>
      <li>Use template for [data definition] on [variable]</li>
      <li>Divide into cases on [condition]</li>
      <li>Use HOF [mapfcn] on [variable]</li>
      <li>Call a more general function</li>
      <!-- <li>[Initialize|Update] state of [??]</li> -->
    </ol>
    <p>For the first few problem sets, you will use ONLY strategies
    1-3.  We will cover the last three in later modules.</p>
    <p>When we get closer to the end of the course, we will let you
    describe your own strategies.  Your strategy should be what you
    would tweet to a friend to describe what you did.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>The function definition.  If your strategy is "Use Template",
    then your code must match the template for the appropriate data
    definition. </li>

    <li>The tests.  Generally, you will define a test suite for each
    function by writing
  <pre>
(begin-for-test
  (check-equal?
    (length lobs-1)
    (length (bombs-after-tick lobs-1))
    "bombs-after-tick did not return a list the same length as its input")
    ...)
</pre>

    <p>Tests created with <kbd>begin-for-test</kbd> will be run at the
    end of the file.</p>

    </li>

  </ol>

</li>

 <h3>Additional Deliverables and Coding Conventions for
 Object-Oriented Programs</h3> 

<ul>

  <li><strong>For Each Interface:</strong><p/>

  <ol>

    <li>Interface names should end in <kbd>&lt;%&gt;</kbd> .</li>
    
    <li>A purpose statement for the interface.</li>

    <li>A data definition of the form
   <pre>
A DataItem is an object of any class that implements DataItem<%>
    </pre>

    (replace <kbd>DataItem</kbd> with the name of your interface.)
</li>
    
    <li>For each method in the interface, a contract and purpose
    statement of the method.  Contracts should always be written in
    terms of data definitions, not interfaces or classes
    (e.g. DataItem, not DataItem&lt;%&gt; or DataItem%).

    <!-- You may write <kbd>Widget</kbd> -->
    <!-- in place of <kbd>Widget&lt;%&gt;</kbd> in contracts if you -->
    <!-- prefer. -->

</li>
  
  </ol></li> <!-- end For Each Interface -->

  <li><strong>For Each Class:</strong><p/>

  <ol>

    <li>Class names should end in <kbd>%</kbd> .</li>
    <li>A purpose statement saying what information the class
    represents. </li>

    <li>A constructor template showing how to build an object of that
    class.  </li>

    <li>Every field (both init-fields and other fields) must have an
    interpretation stating what kind of data is contained in the field
    and what that field represents.  If there is an invariant relating
    two or more fields, it must be stated.</li>

    <li>A set of unit tests that exercise every method and function in
    the class.  In our test framework, these will be located outside
    the class. </li>

    <li>Every method in the class must come from some interface that
    the class implements.  Exception: methods named
    <kbd>for-test:...</kbd> need not be part of any interface, but
    they may only be used for testing.</li>

    <li>A class may not contain any private methods.  Private methods
    should be written as ordinary functions instead.</li>

  </ol>
  
  </li>	<!-- end For Each Class -->

  <li><strong>For Each Method:</strong><p/>

  <ol>
    <li>A contract that is identical to the contract in the
    interface. </li>

    <li>A purpose statement that specializes the purpose statement in
    the interface to the current class.</li>

    <li>Examples, if these are necessary to clarify the purpose
    statement.  These should generally be stated in human-readable
    language. </li>

    <li>A Design Strategy, if needed to explain the method
    definition.  These can be any tweet-sized description of how your
    code works.</li>

    <li>Tests.  These will be part of the unit tests for the class.</li>

  </ol>




  </li> <!-- end For Each Method -->

</ul>
