<strong>Scheme Readings</strong>

<p> If you wish to learn to use Racket as a tool, which is <font
    color="red"><b>not</b></font> the goal of this course, then take a
    look at the following, you should go to <a href="racket-lang.org"
    >racket-lang.org</a>, where you can find lots of resources on
    Racket and its libraries.
</p>

<p>For information about other versions of Scheme and applications,
check out the <a href="http://community.schemewiki.org/" >Community Scheme
Wiki</a>.

<p><strong>Other Readings</strong></p>

<ul>
<!-- <li>If your native language is not English, or even if it is, the -->
<!-- following book will help you improve your writing: -->

<!-- <p>Strunk and White <i>The Elements of Style</a></i> Longman (1918, -->
<!-- 4th ed., 1999). A useful resource on English grammar and usage.  Also -->
<!-- contains many good tips on style. It is not perfect, but it has a lot -->
<!-- of good content.  It is available <a -->
<!-- href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/index.html" target="new">online</a> -->
<!-- but it's far more useful to have the 105-page paperback in your hand, -->
<!-- or on your desk to inspire you. </li> -->

<li> <p><em>BUGS in Writing</em>, by Lyn Dupre (<a
href="https://www.amazon.com/BUGS-Writing-Revised-Guide-Debugging/dp/020137921X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1469067962&sr=1-1&keywords=bugs+in+writing"
>Amazon</a>). A book on writing that many computer scientists find
congenial.  Conveniently divided into many short chapters, each
devoted to a particular kind of writing error.  It's a little fussy,
and the latest printing (which I bought on Amazon in August, 2015)
looks like it was produced on a laser printer that was almost out of
ink.
</li>

<li><em>The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the
21st Century</em>, by Stephen Pinker (<a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0670025852"
>Amazon</a>).  An expert in linguistics analyzes what makes a good
piece of writing work.  Excellent discussion of how to construct a
coherent, compelling narrative.  Lots of detailed discussion of modern
English grammar and usage, which you may find either fascinating or annoying.
Read the opening chapters carefully and you will be amply rewarded.</li>


<li><em>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</em>, by David
Allen.  (<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1262211678&sr=1-1"
target="gtd">Amazon</a>). Most graduate students need some help with
managing their time, and this only gets harder as you go along.  This
is a system of keeping track of your tasks.  It is extremely
nerd-friendly (and I mean that in a good way).  </li>


<li><em>The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People</em>, by Stephen
R. Covey. (<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671708635/002-6581688-4343265?v=glance"
target="habits">Amazon</a>). This
is one of the classic books on time management. It gives guidance on
juggling competing demands on your time, setting (and keeping!)
priorities, and the psychological dimension of time management. I've
had a number of students who found this book invaluable.</li>


<!-- <li>For many of you, this course will be an exercise in personal growth as -->
<!-- you learn to approach tasks in a new way, take criticism, and work in -->
<!-- a very intensive environment.   If you have some favorite books on -->
<!-- this topic, now is a good time to get them out.  Here is one that I -->
<!-- like:</p> -->

<!-- <p>Zen Guitar, by Philip Toshio Sudo. (<a -->
<!-- href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Guitar-Philip-Toshio-Sudo/dp/068483877X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1262212032&sr=1-1" -->
<!-- target="zen">Amazon</a>) When he says "welcome to my dojo", read -->
<!-- "welcome to *my* dojo".  When he says "Pick up your guitar" read "Pick -->
<!-- up your HtDP book, a sheet of paper to design on, and then (and only -->
<!-- then) your keyboard and mouse."  When he says "practice with -->
<!-- intention", read "design the most beautiful program you can."  (And so -->
<!-- far as I know, that is the author's real name: it is not a linux -->
<!-- joke).</li> -->
