<H1>General Policies</H1>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong>

<p>We do not grade on a curve, nor do we have pre-set percentage
cutoffs.  The general grading rubric is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A means that you applied the principles of the course consistently to
  design good programs in a variety of contexts.</li>
  <li>B means that you showed that you understand the principles of
  the course,
  but were not able to apply it consistently.</li> 
  <li>C means that your understanding of the principles of the course was
  insufficient or incomplete, and you would be well served to take the
  course again.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The percentage cutoffs between these grades will vary from semester
to semester, depending on the grades obtained by the students in a
particular class.  </p>

<p>Note that a C does not necessarily require you to take the course
again; you should see your advisor about the implications of your grade.</p>

<p>There is no final exam in this course.</p>

<p> You will get three grades for each homework:</p>

<ol class="condensed">
  <li>Correctness (weight: 30%)</li>
  <li>Design (weight: 50%)</li>
  <li>Presentation (weight: 20%)</li>
</ol>

<p>Correctness is graded numerically, on a scale from 0 to 15. The
grades for Design and Presentation are awarded as letter grades.  The
interpretation of the letter grades is documented in the <a
href="master-rubric-public.txt" >master rubric</a>.</p> 

<p> When computing the final grade, we will drop your lowest-scoring
problem set. Your final score will then be computed as a <a
href="weighted-averages.html" >weighted average</a> of the non-dropped
scores. </p>

<p>I reserve the right to amend this grading policy during the
semester in order to award each student a grade that best reflects his
or her performance and achievements in this course.  </p>

<p><strong>Pair Programming:</strong> For the first five weeks of the
course, you will work individually.  After that, you must work on all
required problems in pairs. The course staff will assign you a
partner. Every few weeks, you will get a new partner. We will attempt
to arrange things so that your assigned partners will be at a level
roughly similar to yours.</p>

<p>When you work in pairs, each of you is responsible for <em>all</em>
the code you turn in.  That means you may be called upon to present
your partner's work at codewalk, so you must be intimately familiar
with the work he or she contributed to the solution.</p>

<p>The best way to guarantee this is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" >pair programming</a>, in which
the two of you work together at a single keyboard, one partner typing
and the other watching, each fully engaged in the problem-solving process.</p>

<p>Being fully responsible for the entire codebase means that if your
partner obtained the code <a href="cheating.html" >illegally</a>,
<strong>you</strong> may be held responsible.  You may be at
particular risk for this if you get most of the problem done and then
leave your partner "to finish writing the tests".  (Note that this
also means that you have violated the design recipe, which says that
you should write the tests for a function before you start the next
function.) </p>


<p><strong>Cheating:</strong> Plagiarism, theft, and other unpleasant
topics are discussed <a href="cheating.html" >here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Travel:</strong>
If you have travel or other responsibilities that will make it impossible for
you to get a particular assignment in on time, please see me <strong>IN
ADVANCE</strong>, and we can make adjustments.
</p>

<p> <strong>DO NOT ASK ME</strong> to schedule your last codewalk
early.  All students are expected to be available for codewalks as
late as <strong>Friday, December 9, 2016</strong>.  Please schedule
your travel around your classwork, not vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Incompletes:</strong>
The college rules state that an incomplete grade may be be available
if the student would otherwise earn a satisfactory grade but is unable
to do so because of extenuating and unforeseen circumstances.  The
student must have already completed a substantial portion of the
course, with passing grades.  An incomplete grade may not be used as a
mechanism to avoid receiving an undesirable grade, nor may it be
awarded to a student on academic warning or probationary status.
</p>

<p>If you have travel or work conflicts, or medical or other problems
that may potentially cause you difficulty in completing your work on
time, please come see me <i>as soon as possible</i>.  In general, I
will be as accomodating as possible if you acquaint me with your
problems in advance.
</p>

<p>You should be aware, however, that no one has gotten an Incomplete in
this course in a very long time.
</p>

<p><strong>Accomodations for Students with Disabilities</strong> If
you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic
accommodations in this course and have not yet met with a Disability
Specialist, please visit <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/drc"
>www.northeastern.edu/drc</a> and follow the outlined procedure to
request services.  </p>

<p>If the Disability Resource Center has formally approved you for 
an academic accommodation in this class, please present the instructor 
with your "Professor Notification Letter" during the first week of the 
semester, so that we can address your specific needs as early as possible.  
</p>

<!-- added for Fall 16, at request of SGA -->

<p><strong>Sexual Violence and Harassment</strong>Title IX makes it
clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil
Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the
same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected
categories such as race, national origin, etc. If you or someone you
know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate
resources here:<a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/oidi/titleix/" > http://www.northeastern.edu/oidi/titleix/</a> .  </p>
