<h1>Plagiarism, Theft, and Other Unpleasant Topics</h1>

<h2 align="center"><strong><span class="new">[** for fall 2017: need to add material
about github.com, etc. **]</span></strong>
</h2>

<p><strong>Plagiarism is Theft: <font color="blue"><em>We will consider all collaborations outside of your assigned
partnership as <font color="red">theft</font>.
This includes telling your friends what we asked
during codewalks.</em></font></strong>
We <font color="red">will</font> report all occurrences to the
administration.  Warning: if you didn't write the code, that fact will
almost always become obvious during codewalks.  Also, we routinely
submit assignments to automated plagiarism detectors.
</p>

<p>Students who are guilty of plagiarism have in the past been suspended
and in exceptional cases dismissed from the program. (I know of one
student who was dismissed from the program a week before graduation!).
</p>

<p>The official University definition of plagiarism is  <a
href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/"
target="new_window">here</a>.  Read it! But we have a simple summary:
<h1 align="center"><span style="color:red">DON'T SHARE BITS</span></h1>
</p>

<p>Here are some typical situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you share files or even portions of files with somebody else, we
<em>will</em> detect it and you <em>will</em> get sent to the
  University 
<a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/" >Office of Student
  Conduct and Resolution</a> (known as OSCCR). Period.  End of story.</li>


<li>If your friend comes and says that he or she is lost and the
problem is due tomorrow, and can he just please look at your solution,
or your data definitions, or even just your test cases, tell him that
the University policy requires that you tell him <em><strong>"NO."</strong></em>  If you give
him or her your files, you <em>will</em> be sent to OSCCR. (And of course he
will be sent to OSCCR.)<p> I know this may be different from the way
things were in your home country, but this is the USA, and we do
things differently here:  we believe that each person rises or falls
on his or her own efforts.</p> </li>

<li>If the problem is due tomorrow and your roommate has solved the
problem and has left his machine unlocked and you will just take a
peek at his solution and maybe just mail yourself a copy,
<strong>DON'T DO IT:</strong> you <strong>WILL</strong> be sent to OSCCR (and your
punishment may be harsher:  theft is much worse than collaboration.)</li>

<li>If you sit in the library with a group of people and you write test
cases on the whiteboard, and you all submit the same test cases, even
with the numbers changed, you <em>will</em> be sent to OSCCR.</li>

<li> <!-- added Sun Oct  5 10:58:17 2014 -->
Your friend tells you about StackOverflow, pastebin, or some other web
site where you can ask a question, share a code snippet, etc., and you
think "Wow! I'll just ask the internet!".  DON'T DO IT: We will find
it (we monitor all the obvious places), and you WILL get sent to
OSCCR.

<p>(It's ok to look for stuff on the internet. If you find something
useful, you must cite your source in a footnote, just like you would
for a research paper.  It's NOT ok to actively ask questions anywhere
but on Piazza.)</p>

<p>(And if you happen to find a solution, or large portions of a
solution, to a problem set from this course, <strong>don't look at
it!</strong> I shouldn't have to tell you that's cheating.)</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>If at any time you feel that you or your partner may have violated
this policy, it is imperative that you contact the course staff
immediately. It will be much the worse for you if our software detects
your indiscretion. If you or your partner have cheated; if you have
any doubt about whether you or your partner have done things honestly;
if, even by accident, your team might have represented any other
person's work as your own: COME TALK TO THE STAFF AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE. You are better off if you work with us than if we have to
come find you.  </p>

<p>A final thought: Students typically report that this course
requires about 20 hours of work per week, so budget your time
accordingly. We know that students who are under time pressure are far
more likely to resort to theft. Time pressure or stress is not an
acceptable excuse. <span style="color:red"><strong>The measure of character is
not what you do when things are easy; it is what you do when things
get tough.</strong></span> </p>

<p><strong>Security:</strong> Guard your work! If you keep your work
on your home machine, be sure your machine is secure, both from
Internet hostiles and from your roommates, etc. If you are not sitting
at your machne, keep it locked! (and don't give anybody the
password). It only takes a minute for your roommate, or for the person
sitting next to you in the hallway, to stick a USB drive in your
machine and steal your work.  <strong>Don't discount this; we have
encountered theft by roommates on a regular basis in the
past.</strong> Remember that physical security is a prerequisite for
information security.</p>

<p>If you keep your local repository on our CCS servers, make sure
that it is protected 600. Leaving it group- or world- readable means
that anyone can steal your work. Your home directory includes, by
default, a directory called <kbd>classes</kbd> that is readable only
by you. Put all your class work here. If you put class material in
some unprotected directory, and somebody else copies it, <em>you</em>
will be held responsible. </p>
