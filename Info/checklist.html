  <h2>
    Pre-Semester Checklist
  </h2>
  <p>
    You should complete these tasks before you arrive on campus
    or shortly after you arrive.
  </p>
  <h3 class="clear">
    Before You Arrive on Campus
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Laptop.
      </strong>
      You probably have a laptop you can bring to class.
      You can do the in-class exercises on paper, but it
      will be easier to use a laptop.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Problem Set 00.
      </strong>
      You should try to complete
      <a href="../ProblemSets/ps00.html">
        Problem Set 00
      </a>
      before the semester starts.
      (We expect Problem Set 00 will be too hard for many of you.
      If it is, then it should be very easy for you to complete.
      To learn why that is so, read the problem set.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        <code>ssh</code> and <code>sftp</code>.
      </strong>
      You may need to install <code>ssh</code> and <code>sftp</code>
      on your laptop or personal computer before you can complete
      <a href="../ProblemSets/ps00.html">
        Problem Set 00.
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Racket.
      </strong>
      Install the latest version of
      <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org/">
        Racket
      </a>
      on your laptop or personal computer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Microsoft Office/PowerPoint
      </strong>
      (optional).
      Most of the online materials are in HTML5 or PDF,
      but they include a few animated slides that will
      not display as intended unless viewed using
      Microsoft PowerPoint.
      Registered students should be able to download
      Microsoft Office 365 for free after logging into
      <a href="http://my.neu.edu/">
        <code>my.neu.edu</code>.
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Reading.
      </strong>
      It would be a good idea to start reading the
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/Draft/part_prologue.html">
        Prologue
      </a>
      and
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/Draft/part_one.html">
        Part I
      </a>
      of the online textbook.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
    When You Arrive on Campus
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>
        CCIS Account.
      </strong>
      <a href="https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0011758">
        Sign up
      </a>
      for a CCIS account.
      You will not be able to submit Problem Set 00
      until you have a CCIS account, and you will need that account
      for WiFi and GitHub access as well.
    </li>
    <li class="gray">
      <strong>
        I Am Here.
      </strong>
      A previous version of this list said CS 5010 has its very own
      <em>I Am Here</em>
      form.
      That is no longer true.
      The <em>I Am Here</em> form has been replaced by an in-class
      quiz and
      <a href="../ProblemSets/ps00.html">
        Problem Set 00.
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Git and GitHub.
      </strong>
      Make sure <code>git</code> is installed on your computer.
      (If you are using Linux, it's probably installed already.
      If you are using a Macintosh, you probably installed <code>git</code>
      when you installed the XCode Command Line Tools.
      If you are using a Windows machine, you may need to download a
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">
        Git client
      </a>
      for your machine.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Piazza.
      </strong>
      Use your CCIS ID to sign up for the
      <a href="http://piazza.com/northeastern/spring2017/cs5010">
        CS 5010 Spring 2017
      </a>
      Piazza discussion board.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Course Web Site.
      </strong>
      Read the other informational web pages shown in the menu
      at the
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs5010sp17/">
        main web site for CS 5010.
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Attend Class.
      </strong>
      If you miss the first meeting of CS 5010, you will already
      have fallen behind.  There are only 14 meetings of the class.
      If you miss just one of them, you are missing 7% of the course.
      (For those of you who care about grades, that means missing
      just one class could easily lower your semester grade
      by half a letter grade.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Study Module 00.
      </strong>
      <a href="../Modules/module00.html">
        Module 00
      </a>
      is designed to get you off to a good start.
