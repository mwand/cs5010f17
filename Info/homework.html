<h1>Submitting Your Homework</h1>

<ul>
  
<li>In this course, we will use <xa href="github.html" >github</a> as
our version control and repository system.  We will use the College
  github server at <a href="http://github.ccs.neu.edu" >github.ccs.neu.edu</a>.
You should visit this site as soon as you have a CCS login in order to
initialize your account there. (See <a href="software.html" >Preparing
Your Laptop</a> for details.)  
</li>

<li>We will create a private repository for you at the CCS github.
We expect you to commit and push your work to this repository <em>at
the end of every work session.</em>  When we get to pair work, we will
create a repository for each pair, shared between you and your partner.</li>

<li>At the end of each work session, you must do two things:<p/>

<ol>
  <li>Commit your work to your private repository.
  </li>
  <li>Fill our a "work session report".  This is a simple Google form
  that asks you to record the time you spent in that work session.
  This form will be customized for each problem set.  A sample is <a
  href="http://goo.gl/forms/zBvBenvP6a" >here</a>.</li> 
</ol>
</li>

<li>If you do not commit and push  your assignments nightly, we will
assume that you are not working on the assignment.  Checking in your
partially-completed assignments also serves to prove that you actually
did the assignment yourself. If you only check in the final version of
your assignment, we will assume that you probably stole the code from
somewhere.  </li>

<li> Nightly check-ins mean that you will always have a backup of your
work.  If you screw things up, you can always revert to an earlier
version.  </li>

<li>Your homework will be collected automatically from your repository
 at the date and time listed on the problem set (usually 6pm local
 time on Monday). </li>


<li>Your homework for problem set JJ should be committed to your
 repository, in a folder named <kbd>setJJ</kbd>.

 <p/>

 <ul>
   <li>Each question should
 be submitted as a single file in that folder, in a file named
 <kbd>NAME.rkt</kbd>, where <kbd>NAME.rkt</kbd> is the filename
 specified in the question.
   </li>

   <li>If the question does not specify a
 filename, then use <kbd>qK.rkt</kbd> for question K.  Thus, if problem
 set 1, question 2 does not specify a filename, then the answer should
 be in a file named exactly <kbd>set01/q2.rkt</kbd> . (Here I've used the Unix/Github convention of using
 <kbd>/</kbd> to separate the components of a path name.)</li>

 <li>If your solution is a file named <kbd>set1/q2.rkt</kbd>,
 <kbd>Set01/q2.rkt</kbd>, <kbd>set 1/question2.rkt</kbd>, or anything
 else, our scripts won't find it, and a variety of bad things will
 happen. 
 </li>

</ul>

 <li>The general deliverables are itemized <a href="deliverables.html"
 >here</a>. </li>

 <li>We have <a href="coding-conventions.html" >coding conventions</a>.
If you follow them, you will make your life and the TA's life easier.</li>

<li>Your submission will be graded according to <a
href="master-rubric-public.txt" >this rubric</a>. The rubric will change
somewhat from week to week, but this shows the general outline. </li>
