  <h2>
    Grading
  </h2>
  <p>
    There will be no midterms or final examinations,
    but your last codewalk may be as late as Monday,
    December 11.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your semester grade is determined by
    problem sets, in-class quizzes and exercises,
    and instructor's discretion.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are no grade quotas, so it is theoretically
    possible for every student to earn an F in the course,
    but that has never happened.
    In past semesters, about one third of the students
    have earned an A, with most of the
    other students earning an A- or some kind of B.
    There are usually a few students who earn a C or F.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Problem Sets
  </h3>
  <p>
    The problem sets determine most of your grade, on the order
    of 90%.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each problem set, you will be given three separate grades:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      correctness (determined by automated black-box testing)
    </li>
    <li>
      presentation (at codewalk)
    </li>
    <li>
      design (which includes your ability to explain your design
      at codewalk)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The correctness score represents 30% of your grade on the problem set,
    the presentation grade is 20%, and the design grade is 50%.
  </p>
  <p>
    The correctness score is numerical.
    The presentation and design grades are letter grades.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Presentation Grades
  </h4>
  <p>
    The presentation grades are given according to the following
    standards:
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      A: Excellent.
    </strong>
    The student understands his/her submission and can explain
    it clearly.  The student speaks clearly and with adequate volume to be
    understood by the audience (not just the grader).  The student
    understands questions as they are asked, and answers them precisely
    and promptly, with little need for followup questions.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      AB: Good, but not excellent.
    </strong>
    The student has a good understanding of
    the submission, and can explain it, though followup questions may be
    necessary in order to get to a precise answer.  The student speaks
    clearly and with adequate volume to be understood by the audience (not
    just the grader).
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      B: Adequate.
    </strong>
    The student has a general understanding of the submission,
    but may be confused or unable to explain some of the details.  The
    student may not speak sufficiently clearly or with adequate volume to
    be understood by the audience (not just the grader).
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      C: Deficient.
    </strong>
    The student's answers may indicate lack of
    understanding of the submission and of the relevant course materials.
    The student may require multiple rephrasings or followup questions in
    order to answer the question; some answers may remain unsatisfactory
    even after multiple interactions with the grader.  The student may
    need to be asked repeatedly to speak more clearly or loudly.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      F: Missing.
    </strong>
    The student did not appear for the codewalk, without giving
    acceptable reason on adequate notice.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Design Grades
  </h4>
  <p>
    The design grades are given according to the following
    standards:
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      A: Excellent.
    </strong>
    The submission is well-organized and
    well-documented.  There are at most a few errors, all minor.
    Everything is
    clear and easy to understand without asking the student
    to explain.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      AB: Good, but not excellent.
    </strong>
    The submission is mostly clear and
    understandable but may lack organization
    or have gaps in detail
    or include errors (in documentation or executable code)
    that hinder a reader's understanding.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      B: Adequate.
    </strong>
    The student understands most of the relevant course
    materials, but the submission shows serious flaws in organization or
    detail.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      C: Deficient.
    </strong>
    The submission indicates lack of understanding of the
    relevant course materials.  Significant portions of the submission are
    not obvious to a reader, even with the supplied documentation.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      D: Incomplete.
    </strong>
    A substantial number of the required deliverables are missing,
    incomplete, or wrong.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>
      F: Missing.
    </strong>
    Not turned in, or so bad as to be little better than nothing.
</p>
<p><a href="grading-checklist.txt" >Here</a> is a partial list of
  specific things that the graders may be checking.</p>


  <h3>
    Quizzes and In-class Exercises
  </h3>
  <p>
    Quizzes and in-class exercises will account for about 5%
    of your semester grade.
    This part of your grade includes being present in class to
    take a quiz, do an exercise, or answer a question when called
    upon at random by the instructor.
  </p>
  <h3 id="discretion">
    Instructor's Discretion
  </h3>
  <p>
    Another small portion of your grade, up to 5%, is determined
    by other factors such as the quality of questions asked in
    class, your helpfulness to other students on Piazza, and
    the course staff's general impression of how well you have
    learned what we're trying to teach.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Re-grade Policy
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you believe we made a mistake when grading one of your
    problem sets, you may submit an
    <em>
      re-grade request
    </em>
    on Piazza.
    A re-grade request should
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      be submitted within 7 days of receiving your grade
    </li>
    <li>
      start a private Piazza thread visible to all instructors
    </li>
    <li>
      have a subject line of the form
      <code>
        re-grade request for problem set N
      </code>
      where N identifies the problem set whose grade is disputed
    </li>
    <li>
      state your full name
    </li>
    <li>
      state your CCIS ID
    </li>
    <li>
      link to your GitHub repository
    </li>
    <!-- <li> -->
    <!--   name your partner (if you have one for that problem set) -->
    <!-- </li> -->
    <li>
      name the TAs who conducted your code walk
    </li>
    <li>
      describe the mistake(s)
    </li>
    <li>
      provide supporting evidence as necessary
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Incomplete or improperly formatted re-grade requests may be ignored.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our resolution of a re-grade request often forces us
    to take a closer look at your submission, and it is not
    unusual for that closer look to result in a lower grade
    instead of a higher grade for the problem set.
