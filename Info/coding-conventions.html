<h1>Coding Conventions</h1>

<p>In addition to following the design recipe, we would like you to
observe basic style guidelines for your programs.  Not observing these
very basic guidelines leads to unreadable code.
</p>

<h2>Layout Conventions</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Start the file with the a purpose statement for the file, the
  requires, and a comment describing how to run the program.  </li>

  <li>Then put constant definitions and data definitions.</li>

  <li>Then put your functions and tests.  Organize your functions into
  meaningful groups.  Put help functions near the functions that they
  help.   If your tests are short, put them near the function they
  test.  Long test suites can be put at the end of the file.</li>

  <li>Use function names and variable names that make sense with
  respect to the problem and the purpose statement.  See the section
  on <a href="#naming-conventions" >Naming Conventions</a> below.
  </li>

  <li>Use consistent indenting.  The Racket indenter does a very good
  job.  A carriage return will, by default, start the next line at the
  right indentation.  As you edit code, lines may wind up improperly
  indented.  TAB correctly re-indents the current line.  If a portion
  of your file is selected (shown in blue), TAB reindents everything
  in the current region.  Type ctl-A TAB to select the entire file and
  reindent the whole thing.</li>

  <li>No line should span more than 80-90 characters.  The position of
  the cursor, including its position on the line, is shown in the
  bottom right of the Racket definitions window. (A few long lines are
  OK, but don't make a habit of it.)
  </li>

  <li>Use visually distinctive separators to divide distinct sections
  of your program.  I tend to use lines consisting of many
  semicolons, but you may use asterisks, dashes, or whatever pleases
  you.  If you have sections and subsections, you can use 2 lines of
  separators between major sections and one line of separators between
  minor sections.  </li>

</ul>

<a name="naming-conventions">
<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>In general, we use the following conventions:</p>

<h3>Function Names</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Choose function names carefully. When a function is used in some
  other piece of code, the reader (that is, someone other than you!)
  should be able to tell roughly what a function computes just by
  looking at its name.  If further detail is needed, then the reader
  can refer to the purpose statement of the function.  If the function
  name is chosen well and the purpose statement is written well, the
  reader should rarely, if ever, need to refer to the function
  definition.  </li>

  <li>Function names should be in lower case.   Use a minus sign
  ("<kbd>-</kbd>") to separate words in function names, e.g.
  <kbd>cat-speed</kbd>, <kbd>world-after-tick</kbd>.</li>
  
  <li>Function names should almost always be nouns.  The function name
  should usually describe the <em>result</em> of the function, not
  what the function does. (e.g. <kbd>area</kbd>, not
  <kbd>compute-area</kbd>)  Use the first component of the name to
  distinguish similar functions with different arguments, e.g.:

  <p/>
  <ul class="condensed">
    <li> circle-area, ring-area </li>
    <li> book-price, total-order-price</li>
    <li> rectangle-after-tick, selected-rectangle-after-tick, unselected-rectangle-after-tick</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Write a WHERE clause in your purpose statement to document the
  meaning of names like this, eg.</p>

  <pre>
rectangle-after-tick : Rectangle -> Rectangle
GIVEN: A rectangle r
RETURNS: The rectangle that should follow the given one after a tick

selected-rectangle-after-tick : Rectangle -> Rectangle
GIVEN: A rectangle r
WHERE: r is selected
RETURNS: The rectangle that should follow the given one after a tick
</pre>
  
  </li>

  <li>Predicates should end in ? : e.g., <kbd>square?</kbd>
  (pronounced "square-huh?") </li>

</ul>

<h3>Variable Names</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We generally use short names for variables (arguments) e.g.,<p/>

  <ul class="condensed">

    <li><kbd>b</kbd>  for a <kbd>Ball</kbd></li>
    <li><kbd>lob</kbd> for a <kbd>ListOfBall</kbd></li>

  </ul></li>

  <li> It is preferable to use mnemonic names, like <kbd>cost</kbd> or
  <kbd>price</kbd>, or qualified names, like <kbd>mouse-x</kbd> or
  <kbd>bomb-x</kbd>, rather than names that merely identify the data
  type of the variable.

  <li>Sometimes I'll use plural names or abbreviations for lists, such as
    <kbd>balls</kbd> or <kbd>bs</kbd> for a <kbd>ListOfBall</kbd></li>

</ul>


<h3>Other Names</h3>

<ul>

  <li>  Global constants are in upper-case:  eg. <kbd>HEIGHT</kbd>, <kbd>WIDTH</kbd>, <kbd>BALL-SPEED</kbd>
  </li>
  
  <li>Names of data definitions are in <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase" >CamelCase</a>:
  e.g. <kbd>ListOfNumber</kbd>, <kbd>World</kbd>,
  <kbd>FallingCatKeyEvent</kbd> .</li>


  <li> Everything else is in lower case, including names of structs
  and functions. Use a minus sign ("<kbd>-</kbd>") to separate words
  in procedure names, e.g.  <kbd>cat-speed</kbd>,
  <kbd>world-after-tick</kbd>.</li>

  <li> Names of interfaces are Capitalized, like data definitions, and
  end in &lt;%&gt;</li>

  <li> Names of clases of Capitalized, like data definitions, and end
  in %.</li>

</ul>


<a name="help-functions">

<h2>Use Help Functions to Simplify Your Code</h2>

<p>Use help functions to clarify your intentions in a piece of code.
That messy junk you just wrote in your function must have had some
purpose.  Turn it into a help function so you can document its
purpose, and give it independent tests.</p>

<p><strong>Short is good.  Long is bad. Period.</strong></p>


<p>Here are two radically different versions of the same function.</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <th>bad</th>
    <th>good</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>
; ball-after-tick : Ball -> Ball
(define (ball-after-tick b)
  (cond
    [(and (<= YUP (where b) YLO)
       (or (<= (ball-x b) XWALL
             (+ (ball-x b)
               (ball-dx b)))
         (>= (ball-x b) XWALL
           (+ (ball-x b)
             (ball-dx b)))))
     (make-ball
       (- (* 2 XWALL)
         (ball-x (straight b 1.)))
       (ball-y (straight b 1.))
       (- (ball-dx (straight b 1.)))
       (ball-dy (straight b 1.)))]
    [else (straight b 1.)])) 
      </pre>
    </td>

    <td valign="top" style="background-color: #eeeed0">
      <pre>
; ball-after-tick : Ball -> Ball
(define (ball-after-tick b)
  (cond
   [(would-hit-wall? b) (ball-at-wall-reversed b)]
   [else (ball-after-straight-move b 1.)]))
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>Both always return the same answer.  But which one do you understand
immediately? Which programming style makes sense? Which will drive the
TA crazy? </p>
