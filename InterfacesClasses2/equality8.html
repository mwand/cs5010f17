      The definition of <code>t2</code> is rather interesting:
</p>
    <pre>
          public boolean equals (Object x) {
              if (x instanceof UTC) {
                  <span class="red">UTC t2 = (UTC) x;</span>
                  return isEqual (t2);
              }
              else return false;
          }
</pre>
    <p>
      That line defines a local variable named <code>t2</code> whose
      value is the same as the value of <code>x</code>.
      Defining a second variable with the same value may seem pointless,
      but it's convenient because the
      type of the expression <code>t2</code> is <code>UTC</code>,
      whereas the type of the expression <code>x</code> is <code>Object</code>.
      If we were to try to pass <code>x</code> as an argument to the
      <code>isEqual</code> method, the Java compiler would report
      a type error because the <code>isEqual</code> method only
      accepts arguments of type <code>UTC</code>.
</p>
    <p>
      The right hand side of the variable declaration for <code>t2</code>
      <em>casts</em> <code>x</code> from type <code>Object</code> to
      type <code>UTC</code>.
      That <em>cast</em> is a type conversion.
      It tells the Java compiler not to complain about the fact
      that the type of <code>x</code> is different from <code>UTC</code>.
</p>
    <blockquote class="smaller">
      <p>
        In some unsafe programming languages, compilers just
        trust the programmer and perform the type conversion
        without checking to see whether the value of <code>x</code>
        actually supports the operations listed in the <code>UTC</code>
        interface.
        If the programmer makes a mistake, the program will blow up
        (if we're lucky) or generate incorrect results (if we're unlucky).
        That's why programming languages in which compilers trust
        the programmer's casts without checking are said to be unsafe.
</p>
      <p>
        In Java, C#, and other safe languages, compilers don't
        just trust the programmer.  Compilers generate code that
        will check the value of <code>x</code> at run time to make sure
        it is safe to use that value as though it were a <code>UTC</code>.
        If that run-time check fails, it will throw an exception
        that can be handled by an exception handler programmers
        have written to deal with such mistakes.
        At worst, if the programmers have not defined an exception handler,
        a default exception handler will report the error, along with
        information that will make it easier to fix the program,
        and terminate the program in a clean manner.
        That's part of why programming languages such as Java and C#
        are said to be safe.
