  <h2>
    Advantages of Abstract Data Types
</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Abstract data types offer several advantages
      over concrete data types:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Representation Independence:</strong>
        Most of the program becomes independent of
        the abstract data type's representation,
        so that representation can be improved
        without breaking the entire program.
</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Modularity:</strong>
        With representation independence, the different parts
        of a program become less dependent on other parts
        and on how those other parts are implemented.
</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interchangeability of Parts:</strong>
        Different implementations of an abstract data type
        may have different performance characteristics.
        With abstract data types, it becomes easier
        for each part of a program to use an implementation
        of its data types that will be more efficient for
        that particular part of the program.
</li>
</ul>
    <blockquote class="indented">
      <p>
        Example:
</p>
      <p>
        Java's standard libraries supply several different
        implementations of its <code>Map</code> data type.
        The <code>TreeMap</code> implementation might be
        more efficient when a total ordering on the keys
        can be computed quickly but a good hash value is
        hard to compute efficiently.
        The <code>HashMap</code> implementation might be
        more efficient when hash values can be computed
        quickly and there is no obvious ordering on keys.
        The part of a program that creates a <code>Map</code>
        can decide which implementation to use.
        The parts of a program that deal with a created
        <code>Map</code> don't have to know how it was
        implemented; once created, it's just a <code>Map</code>.
</p>
      <p>
        If it weren't for abstract data types, every part
        of the program that uses a <code>Map</code> would
        have to be written twice, with one version to deal with
        <code>TreeMap</code> implementations
        and another version to deal with
        <code>HashMap</code> implementations.
</p>
</blockquote>
    <p>
      These advantages become more important in larger programs,
      so they often go under-appreciated by programmers with
      limited experience.
