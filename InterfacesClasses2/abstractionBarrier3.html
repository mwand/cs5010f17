  <h2>
    Abstraction Barrier
</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      It is not unusual for programmers to use an abstract data type
      they themselves have helped to implement.
      When they were implementing that data type, it was
      (for them at that time)
      a concrete data type.
</p>
    <p>
      When those same programmers use that abstract data type
      in the way it was intended to be used by others,
      it is an abstract data type.
</p>
    <p>
      This often causes confusion
      among inexperienced programmers, and sometime even among
      experienced programmers.
      To reduce that confusion, and to reduce errors caused by
      that confusion, modern programming languages make it
      possible to hide the representation of an abstract data type
      from programmers who should not be relying upon that
      representation.
</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        When the data type is defined by a Java interface,
        the Java compiler prevents you from relying upon
        the representation of its values.
