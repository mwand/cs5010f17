    <h3>
      Why We Need Static Methods
</h3>
    <p>
      Before we can call a dynamic method using the
      <code>x.f(...)</code> syntax,
      we have to create the object <code>x</code>
      that will act as <em>receiver</em> for the call.
</p>
    <p>
      When a Java program first begins to execute,
      before any objects have been created,
      there are no objects that could act as receiver
      for a dynamic method call.
</p>
    <p>
      To create the first objects, we have to call
      at least one static method.
</p>
    <p>
      In Java, the first method called is the static method
      named <code>main</code> that is defined in the class
      we named on the command line that invoked the JVM.
</p>
    <p>
      If we invoke the JVM by saying <code>java Class1</code>,
      then the JVM starts the program by calling the
      static <code>main</code> method defined in class <code>Class1</code>.
      If we invoke the JVM by saying <code>java Foo</code>,
      then the JVM starts the program by calling the
      static <code>main</code> method defined in class <code>Foo</code>.
</p>
    <p>
      A Java program can therefore have multiple main entry points,
      each defined in a separate class.
      As will be explained in the next lesson,
      multiple entry points are convenient for unit testing.
