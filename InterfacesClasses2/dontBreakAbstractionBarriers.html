    Don't Break the Abstraction Barrier
</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Programming languages may also include special-purpose features
      that allow debuggers and similar tools to work around
      abstraction barriers that would otherwise be enforced
      by the language.
</p>
    <p>
      Good programmers do not use those features to break
      abstraction barriers.
</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Java includes a few features that can be misused
        to obtain knowledge of an abstract data type's
        representation.
        Inappropriate use of those features, which include
        <code>instanceof</code>, <code>getClass</code>, and casts,
        marks you as an inexperienced or weak programmer.
</p>
      <p>
        In this course, you should use <code>instanceof</code>
        and casts only when writing an <code>equals</code> method
        as shown in the next lesson.
        You should never use <code>getClass</code>.
</p>
      <p>
        You should try to follow that rule outside of this course
        as well.
        If you find yourself resorting to features we forbid
        in this course, you should ask yourself:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Am I doing this because I am not a good programmer?
</li>
        <li>
          Or am I doing this because the job I am doing forces
          me to use a poorly designed data type?
</li>
</ul>
