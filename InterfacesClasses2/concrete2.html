      Examples of Concrete and Abstract Data Types:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <code>MouseEvent</code> data type defined by Racket
        is a concrete data type.
        <blockquote>
          You know its values are strings,
          and you know the possible values of those strings
          (such as <code>"button-down"</code>).
          You are allowed to rely upon that representation when
          you write functions that process a <code>MouseEvent</code>.
</blockquote>
</li>
      <li>
        The structure types you designed and defined
        near the beginning of the semester
        were concrete types.
        <blockquote>
          You knew the field names of each structure,
          and you relied upon that knowledge in your observer templates
          and in functions that used those observer templates.
</blockquote>
</li>
      <li>
        The <code>char[]</code> type of Java is concrete.
        <blockquote>
          You know the values of that type are represented as
          0-origin arrays of fixed length,
          and you know every element of those arrays is
          represented by a 16-bit integer.
</blockquote>
</li>
      <li>
        The <code>List</code> type of Java is abstract.
        <blockquote>
          You do not know how values of that type are represented.
          A value of the <code>List</code> type might be
          a <code>LinkedList</code>,
          an <code>ArrayList</code>,
          a <code>CopyOnWriteArrayList</code>,
          or an object of some class defined by the course staff
          whose representation will never be revealed to you.
          Methods that are passed a <code>List</code> argument can
          observe properties of that argument by calling the methods
          listed by the <code>List</code> interface,
          but they cannot rely on the representation of the
          argument.
</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Note also that, in general, you do not even know whether
          a value of the <code>List</code> type is mutable.
          All of the methods listed by the <code>List</code> interface that
          are capable of modifying a list's state are <em>optional</em>.
          You cannot use optional methods unless a precondition
          or some other invariant tells you the methods are available
          for you to use.
