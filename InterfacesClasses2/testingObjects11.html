    <h3>
      Testing Across Classes is Hard
</h3>
    <p>
      Testing across multiple classes that implement the same
      interface is hard to do well.
</p>
    <p>
      For one thing, the tests have to know all of the classes
      that implement the interface.  For black-box testing,
      knowing all classes is generally impossible.
</p>
    <p>
      For another thing, more classes that implement the interface
      might be added over time as the program evolves.
      It's hard to keep the tests in sync with the program.
</p>
    <p>
      If the tested classes are designed to be extended using
      inheritance, testing all classes that implement the
      interface entails testing all subclasses as well.
      That, too, is generally impossible to accomplish with
      black-box testing, and it's especially hard to keep the
      tests in sync with the program as new subclasses come and
      go due to refactoring.
