      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
</p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you practice
      implementing abstract data types, both mutable and immutable.
      The problem set will also give you some practice implementing
      <code>equals(Object)</code>,
      <code>hashCode()</code>,
      <code>toString()</code>, and
      <code>iterator()</code>
      methods.
</p>
    <p>
      We will test your program using Java 8,
      which is the version of Java installed on CCIS Linux machines.
      You will therefore want to use Java 8 when developing and
      testing your program.
</p>
    <p>
      For these problems, we are giving you the following files:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>Player.java</code>
</li>
      <li>
        <code>Roster.java</code>
</li>
</ul>
    <p class="strong red">
      <em>You must not change those files in any way.</em>
</p>
    <p>
      Parts 1 and 2 of this problem set ask you to create two
      more files named
      <code>Players.java</code> and
      <code>Rosters.java</code>.
      Both of those files must be in the default package.
      In other words, your Java files should not contain any
      <code>package</code> declarations.
</p>
    <p>
      You are free to create additional files.
      When we test your submission, we will compile all of the
      Java files in your <code>set10</code> directory using the
      following command:
</p>
    <pre>
      javac *.java
</pre>
    <p>
      You should start by downloading the two files we are giving you,
      unpacking them into a <code>set10</code> directory,
      and pushing that directory to your GitHub repository.
</p>
    <p>
      We are giving you a choice of two formats in which to download
      the files we are giving you.  Both of these links will unpack
      to the same <code>set10</code> directory containing exactly
      the same Java files:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="set10.tgz">
          <code>set10.tgz</code>
</a>
</li>
      <li>
        <a href="set10.zip">
          <code>set10.zip</code>
</a>
</li>
</ul>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
</p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">work session report</a>
      at the end of each work session.
      <span class="red">Be sure to report only the hours
      spent in that work session;
      do <strong><em>not</em></strong> report the cumulative time</span>.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add your work session report
      to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set10</code> directory.
      <strong><em>Do this at the end of every work session.</em></strong>

      This problem set asks you to implement two abstract data types,
      <code>Player</code> and <code>Roster</code>.
      These ADTs would be useful to the coaches of a team sport
      as they consider different rosters they might use for an
      upcoming game.
      In the NFL, for example, a team's roster can contain up to
      53 players, but some of those players may be unavailable
      because of suspension or injury.
      On game day, the head coach must designate a smaller roster
      with no more than 46 players, and coaches routinely consider
      several of those smaller rosters before deciding which roster to
      use in the game.
</p>
    <p>
      To make it easier to consider several similar rosters, the
      <code>Roster</code> ADT is immutable.
      The <code>Player</code> ADT is mutable, however, because an
      injury, trade, or some other change to a player's status should
      be propagated immediately to all rosters that use the player.
</p>
    <pre>
      // A Player is an object of any class that implements the Player interface.
      //
      // A Player object represents a member of a team.
      // Player objects are mutable because their status can change without
      // changing the identity of the Player.
      // 
      // If p1 and p2 are players, then p1.equals(p2) if and only if
      // p1 and p2 are the same object (i.e. (p1 == p2), p1 and p2
      // have the same name and status, and changing the status of p1
      // necessarily changes the status of p2 in the same way).
      //
      // If p is a player, then p.hashCode() always returns the same
      // value, even after the player's status is changed by calling
      // one of the last three methods listed below.
      //
      // If p1 and p2 are players with distinct names, then
      // p1.toString() is not the same string as p2.toString().
      //
      // Players.make(String name) is a static factory method that returns
      // a player with the given name who is (initially) available.
      
      interface Player {
      
          // Returns the name of this player.

          // Returns true iff this player is suspended.
      
          boolean isSuspended ();
      
          // Changes the underContract() status of this player
          // to the specified boolean.

You may not change these interfaces in any way, but you may define new
    interfaces that extend them.

          For this first part of Problem Set 10, you will define
          a public class named <code>Players</code> in a file named
          <code>Players.java</code>.
          That class will define a public static factory method
          named <code>make</code> that takes a <code>String</code>
          as its one and only argument and returns a <code>Player</code>
          whose name is the given string.  
</p>
</li>
      <li>
        (Roster)
        <br />

          For this second part of Problem Set 10, you will define
          a public class named <code>Rosters</code> in a file named
          <code>Rosters.java</code>.
          That class will define a public static factory method
          named <code>empty</code> that takes no arguments
          and returns an empty roster.

          HINT: <code>iterator()</code> methods are often implemented
          by creating an object of some predefined class and
          then creating the desired iterator by
          calling that object's <code>iterator</code> method.
