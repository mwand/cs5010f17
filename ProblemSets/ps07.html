      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you practice
      designing functions with invariants.
      Another purpose is to give you more practice with the System
      Design Recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Racket's
      <strong>Intermediate Student Language + Lambda</strong>
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">extras.rkt</a>
      and put it in the directory with your solutions.
      Then import <code>rackunit</code> and this library
      by including the lines
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require rackunit)
      (require "extras.rkt")
</pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file.
      Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)
</pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous
      problem sets.
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check
      that your solutions are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">deliverables</a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">coding conventions</a>.
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">work session report</a>
      at the end of each work session.
      <span class="red">Be sure to report only the hours
      spent in that work session;
      do <strong><em>not</em></strong> report the cumulative time</span>.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add your work session report
      to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set06</code> directory.
      <strong><em>Do this at the end of every work session.</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set07</code> directory along with your
      <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>q2.rkt</code> files.
    </p>
    <p>
      For both parts, you should require <code>rackunit</code> and
      <code>"extras.rkt"</code> but nothing else.
    </p>

      <li>
        (Undefined Variables)
        <br />
        <p>
          For this first part of Problem Set 07, you will design
          a function named <code>undefined-variables</code> that
          checks an arithmetic expression to see whether all of
          its variables are defined and are used only within the
          <em>region</em> in which they are defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the following sentences are taken from the
          current standard for the Scheme programming language,
          similar remarks apply to most of the programming languages
          you have used or will use during your career:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          To each place where an identifier is bound in a program
          there corresponds a region of the program text within
          which the binding is visible.  The region is determined
          by the particular binding construct that establishes
          the binding; if the binding is established by a lambda
          expression, for example, then its region is the entire
          lambda expression.  Every mention of an identifier refers
          to the binding of the identifier that established the
          innermost of the regions containing the use.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In the language of arithmetic expressions, as introduced
          by Problem Set 05, blocks are the only binding constructs.
          When a variable is defined by a block, its region is the
          body of the block.
        </p>
        <p>
          Variables with the same name may be defined by more than one
          block, so there may be more than one region corresponding
          to a variable with that name.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a variable is used within an arithmetic expression but
          at least one of its uses does not lie within any region
          established by a definition of the variable, then the
          variable is said to be <em>undefined</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q1.rkt</code>
          that
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            defines all of the data types named in part 1 of
            Problem Set 05,
          </li>
          <li>
            including the <code>OperationName</code> and
            <code>ArithmeticExpression</code> types whose definitions
            we gave you,
          </li>
          <li>
            defines and provides all 18 of the functions
            specified in part 1 of Problem Set 05,
            with one change to the <code>block</code> function's
            contract: for Problem Set 07, <code>block</code>
            returns a <code>Block</code>,
          </li>
          <li>
            and defines and provides the <code>undefined-variables</code>
            function specified below.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The 19 functions you must define and <code>provide</code>
          are:
        </p>
        <pre>
          ;;; lit : Real -&gt; Literal
          ;;; literal-value : Literal -&gt; Real
          ;;; var : String -&gt; Variable
          ;;; variable-name : Variable -&gt; String
          ;;; op : OperationName -&gt; Operation
          ;;; operation-name : Operation -&gt; OperationName

          ;;; operation? : ArithmeticExpression -&gt; Boolean
          ;;; call?      : ArithmeticExpression -&gt; Boolean
          ;;; block?     : ArithmeticExpression -&gt; Boolean
          ;;;
          ;;; (Those 18 functions are as specified in Problem Set 07,
          ;;; except we have changed the return type of the
          ;;; block function from ArithmeticExpression to Block.)
          
          ;;; undefined-variables : ArithmeticExpression -&gt; StringList
          ;;; GIVEN: an arbitrary arithmetic expression
          ;;; RETURNS: a list of the names of all undefined variables
          ;;;     for the expression, without repetitions, in any order
          ;;; EXAMPLE:
          ;;;     (undefined-variables
          ;;;      (call (var "f")
          ;;;            (list (block (var "x")
          ;;;                         (var "x")
          ;;;                         (var "x"))
          ;;;                  (block (var "y")
          ;;;                         (lit 7)
          ;;;                         (var "y"))
          ;;;                  (var "z"))))
          ;;;  =&gt; some permutation of (list "f" "x" "z")
</pre>


<p>For both questions in this set, you should review any code that you
reuse from Problem Sets 05 and 06, repair any defects that were noted
in your previous submissions, and improve your code where
possible. </p>

<p>
          We will be doing automated testing of your solution,
          so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set07/q1.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010f17/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></code> repository),
          and that it provides all the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line at the top of your file but after your
          <code>require</code> declarations:
        </p>
        <pre>
          (check-location "07" "q1.rkt")
</pre>
      </li>

    <li>
      (Type Checking)
      <br />
      <p>
        For this second problem, your job is to write a type checker
        for arithmetic expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll need the following definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A type is one of
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>Int</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Op0</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Op1</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Error</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The type of an arithmetic expression is defined as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The type of a <code>Literal</code> is <code>Int</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              If a <code>Variable</code> is used outside of any region
              for the variable, then the type of that use of the variable is
              <code>Error</code>;
              otherwise the type of that use of the variable
              is the type of the expression on the right hand side of the
              innermost definition of the variable whose region includes
              the use.
            </li>
            <li>
              The type of <code>(op "+")</code> is <code>Op0</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The type of <code>(op "*")</code> is <code>Op0</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The type of <code>(op "-")</code> is <code>Op1</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The type of <code>(op "/")</code> is <code>Op1</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the operator of a call has type
              <code>Op0</code>, and all of its operands have type
              <code>Int</code>, then the type of the call is
              <code>Int</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the operator of a call has type
              <code>Op1</code>, and all of its operands have type
              <code>Int</code>, and there is at least one operand,
              then the type of the call is
              <code>Int</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If neither of the two rules above specifies the type
              of a call, then its type is
              <code>Error</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the right-hand side of a block's definition has type
              <code>Error</code>, then the type of that block is
              <code>Error</code>;
              otherwise the type of the block is the type of its
              body.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          An arithmetic expression is well-typed if and only if
          its type is not <code>Error</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are to deliver a file named <code>q2.rkt</code>
        that defines all of the data types from part 1,
        defines and provides all 19 of the functions
        specified in part 1 above, and also
        defines and provides the <code>well-typed?</code> function
        specified below
        (so you will provide 20 functions in all):
      </p>
      <pre>
        ;;; well-typed? : ArithmeticExpression -&gt; Boolean
        ;;; GIVEN: an arbitrary arithmetic expression
        ;;; RETURNS: true if and only if the expression is well-typed
        ;;; EXAMPLES:
        ;;;     (well-typed? (lit 17))  =&gt;  true
        ;;;     (well-typed? (var "x"))  =&gt;  false
        ;;;

        Instead of copying most of your <code>q1.rkt</code> file
        into <code>q2.rkt</code>, you may choose to have your

        <code>q1.rkt</code> file.
        If you do that, however, your <code>q2.rkt</code> file
