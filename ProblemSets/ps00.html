      The main purpose of this problem set is to give us some idea of
      your programming skills at the beginning of the semester, when
      most of you are just starting the MS program.  This problem set
      will also allow us to identify students whose programming skills
      are strong enough for us to invite them to take a programming
      test that could result in this course being waived for those
      students.  Students who do not do well on Problem Set 00 will
      not be allowed to take that placement test.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Problem Set 00 may be too hard for you to finish before
      its due date, in which case you should still submit a plain text
      (Latin-1 or UTF-8) file named <code>README</code>
      (not <code>README.txt</code>) that says
      <code>Problem Set 00 is too hard for me.</code>  Students who submit a
      <code>README</code> file that begins with that sentence will receive full
      credit for Problem Set 00, but will not be allowed to take the
      placement test.
</p>

      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
