    <p>
      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you some practice
      with the systems we will use in CS 5010.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, you need to know how to commit your solution
      and how to push your commits to the course's GitHub site.
      To submit your solution, follow our instructions on
      <a href="../Info/submission.html">How to Submit Your Homework</a>,
      and be sure to include the required
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">deliverables</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will check to see whether your have submitted a solution
      for this problem set and whether it contains the required
      deliverables, but this problem set will not otherwise be
      graded.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Racket's HtDP Intermediate Student Language (ISL)
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should begin your work on this problem set by using
      <code>git</code> to clone your GitHub repository from the
      <a href="https://github.ccs.neu.edu/cs5010f17">CS 5010 GitHub site</a>.
      The name of your GitHub repository is
      <code>pdp-</code><var>YOURNAME</var>, where <var>YOURNAME</var>
      is your CCIS ID.
      Your repository will probably be empty when you clone it.
      Within your cloned repository, you should create a new
      directory named <code>set01</code>.
      All of the code you write for this problem set will go into
      that directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also need to download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt"><code>extras.rkt</code></a>
      and put it in your <code>set01</code> directory along with
      the <code>q1.rkt</code> through <code>q5.rkt</code> files
      you will write for this problem set.
      Each of those files must import that library by including
      the lines
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require rackunit)
      (require "extras.rkt")
</pre>
    <p>
      near the top of the file, preceded only by your comments
      describing the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately following those <code>require</code> declarations,
      your file should state a <code>provide</code> declaration for
      each deliverable function.
      Those <code>provide</code> declarations allow our testing
      infrastructure to <code>require</code> your file and check
      to see whether you've provided all of the deliverable functions.
      <span class="red">
        Also, include a line calling <code>check-location</code>
        to check whether your file is correctly named and in the
        right place in your repository.
      </span>
      That call to <code>check-location</code> <em>must</em> be
      placed after the <code>require</code> declarations,
      but can go before the <code>provide</code> declarations.
      Thus, for problem 1, the top of your file should say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require rackunit)
      (require "extras.rkt")
      (check-location "01" "q1.rkt")
      
      (provide pyramid-volume)
</pre>
    <p>
      Remember to follow the design recipe.  Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">deliverables</a>
      include the data definitions you need (including interpretations
      and templates), contracts, purpose statements, examples and tests,
      and design strategies in addition to your function definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to fill out a
      <a href="../Info/yourID-log.txt">work session report</a>
      at the end of each
      work session.  Tell <code>git</code> to <code>add</code> it to
      the files you will commit, and then commit and push that report
      in addition to committing and pushing your entire
      <code>set01</code> directory.  Do this at the end of every work
      session.
    </p>

      <li>
        Write a function named <code>pyramid-volume</code>
        that, given values <var>x</var> and <var>h</var>
        in units of meters, returns the volume in cubic meters of
        a pyramid of height <var>h</var> whose square bottom
        has sides of length <var>x</var>.
        (Hint: the volume of any pyramid is one third the area
        of its base times its height.)
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q1.rkt</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A few countries have not yet converted to the metric system.
        Write a function named <code>furlongs-to-barleycorns</code>
        that, given a length in furlongs, returns the number of
        barleycorns in that length.
        (Hint: one furlong is ten chains; one chain is four rods;
        one rod is sixteen and a half feet; one foot is twelve inches;
        one inch is three barleycorns.
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q2.rkt</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a function named <code>kelvin-to-fahrenheit</code>
        that, given a temperature in Kelvin, returns the number
        of Fahrenheit degrees.
        (Hint: 0 K is -273.15 degrees Celsius, and 273.15 K is
        0 degrees Celsius.)
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q3.rkt</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        For scientific applications, the speed of a microprocessor
        is often expressed as the number of floating point operations
        it can perform per second; one floating point operation per
        second equals 1 FLOPS.
        Write a function named <code>flopy</code> that,
        given the speed of a microprocessor in FLOPS,
        returns the number of floating point operations
        it can perform in one 365-day year, with each day
        consisting of exactly 24 hours.
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q4.rkt</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Java type <code>double</code> consists of 2<sup>64</sup>
        distinct values, and double precision addition takes
        two of those values as inputs, so exhaustive testing of
        double precision addition involves 2<sup>128</sup> additions.
        Write a function named <code>years-to-test</code> that,
        given the speed of a microprocessor in FLOPS,
        returns the number of 365-day years it would take to test
        the double precision addition operation on all legal inputs.
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q5.rkt</code>.
      </li>
