      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you practice
      designing functions with general recursion and halting measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Racket's
      <strong>Intermediate Student Language + Lambda</strong>
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">extras.rkt</a>
      and put it in the directory with your solutions.
      Then import <code>rackunit</code> and this library
      by including the lines
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require rackunit)
      (require "extras.rkt")
</pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file.
      Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)
</pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous
      problem sets.
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check
      that your solutions are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">deliverables</a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">coding conventions</a>.
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">work session report</a>
      at the end of each work session.
      <span class="red">Be sure to report only the hours
      spent in that work session;
      do <strong><em>not</em></strong> report the cumulative time</span>.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add your work session report
      to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code><span class="strike">set06</span><span class="new">set08</span></code> directory.
      <strong><em>Do this at the end of every work session.</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set08</code> directory along with your
      <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>q2.rkt</code> files.
    </p>
    <p>
      For both parts, you should require <code>rackunit</code> and
      <code>"extras.rkt"</code> but nothing else.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This problem set deals with the problem of ranking individuals
      or teams in a sport such as chess whose contests result in a
      win or tie (draw).
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike most ranking systems, the ranking system you will
      implement treats a tie as a win for both competitors and
      also as a loss for both competitors.  (This problem set may
      help to explain why most ranking systems don't do that.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We will use strings to name competitors:
    </p>
    <pre>
      ;;; A Competitor is represented as a String (any string will do).
</pre>
    <ol>
      <li>
        (Outranking)
        <br />
        <p>
          For this first part of Problem Set 08, you will design
          data types named <code>Tie</code> and <code>Defeat</code>.
          A <code>Tie</code> represents a tie (draw) between two
          competitors.  A <code>Defeat</code> represents the outcome
          of a contest in which one competitor wins and the other
          loses.  The outcome of a contest is either a <code>Tie</code>
          or a <code>Defeat</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
          ;;; An Outcome is one of
          ;;;     -- a Tie
          ;;;     -- a Defeat
          ;;;
          ;;; OBSERVER TEMPLATE:
          ;;; outcome-fn : Outcome -&gt; ??
          #;
          (define (outcome-fn o)
            (cond ((tie? o) ...)
                  ((defeat? o) ...)))
</pre>
        <p>
          The ranking system specified below uses this definition:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Given a list of outcomes, a competitor A outranks a
            competitor B if any of the following are true:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              One of the outcomes shows that A has defeated B.
            </li>
            <li>
              One of the outcomes shows that A and B have tied.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a competitor C that outranks B according to
              the list of outcomes, and there is an outcome that
              shows A has defeated or tied C.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q1.rkt</code>
          that
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            defines the <code>Competitor</code>,
            <code>Tie</code>, <code>Defeat</code>, and
            <code>Outcome</code> types;
            the <code>Competitor</code> and <code>Outcome</code>
            types must be defined as shown above
          </li>
          <li>
            defines and provides all 5 of the functions
            specified below
          </li>
          <li>
            gives halting measures for all functions that may
            call themselves directly or indirectly
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The 5 functions you must define and <code>provide</code>
          are:
        </p>
        <pre>
          ;;; tie : Competitor Competitor -&gt; Tie

          We will be doing automated testing of your solution,
          so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set08/q1.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010f17/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></code> repository),
          and that it provides all the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line at the top of your file but after your
          <code>require</code> declarations:
        </p>

        (Power Ranking)
        <br />
        <p>
          For this second problem, your job is to implement a
          power-ranking system based on the types and functions
          you defined in part 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given a list of outcomes, the non-losing percentage
          of a competitor A is the number of outcomes in which
          A defeats or ties another competitor divided by the
          number of outcomes that mention A.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power-ranking system you will implement has the
          following characteristics:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If competitor A is outranked by fewer competitors than
            competitor B, then the power-ranking of A is higher than
            the power-ranking of B.
          </li>
          <li>
            If competitor A is outranked by the same number of competitors
            as competitor B, but competitor A outranks more competitors
            than competitor B, then the power-ranking of A is higher than
            the power-ranking of B.
          </li>
          <li>
            If competitor A is outranked by the same number of competitors
            as competitor B, and competitor A also outranks the same number
            of competitors as competitor B,
            and competitor A has a higher non-losing percentage than
            competitor B,
            then the power-ranking of A is higher than
            the power-ranking of B.
          </li>
          <li>
            If competitor A is outranked by the same number of competitors
            as competitor B, and competitor A also outranks the same number
            of competitors as competitor B,
            and competitor A has the same non-losing percentage as
            competitor B,
            and Racket's <code>string&lt;?</code> function considers
            the name of competitor A to be less than
            the name of competitor B,
            then the power-ranking of A is higher than
            the power-ranking of B.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q2.rkt</code>
          that defines all of the data types from part 1,
          defines and provides all 5 of the functions
          specified in part 1 above, and also
          defines and provides the <code>power-ranking</code> function
          specified below
          (so you will provide 6 functions in all).
          As in part 1, you are to give halting measures
          for all functions that may
          call themselves directly or indirectly.
        </p>
        <pre>
          ;;; power-ranking : OutcomeList -> CompetitorList
          ;;; GIVEN: a list of outcomes

          ;;;     of the outcomes, without repetitions, with competitor A
          ;;;     coming before competitor B in the list if and only if
          ;;;     the power-ranking of A is higher than the power ranking
          ;;;     of B.

          Instead of copying most of your <code>q1.rkt</code> file
          into <code>q2.rkt</code>, we suggest you have your
          <code>q2.rkt</code> file <code>require</code> your
          <code>q1.rkt</code> file.
          Remember, however, that <strong>your <code>q2.rkt</code> file
          must still <code>provide</code> all 6 functions</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that we will be doing automated testing of your solution,
          so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set08/q2.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010f17/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></code> repository),
          and that it provides all of the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line at the top of your file but after your
          <code>require</code> declarations:
