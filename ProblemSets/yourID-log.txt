After each work session, please update and commit this file with the amount of
time you spent working, the date when you stopped, and any notes you wish to
make for yourself.  Every commit of this file constitutes a work log entry.
Each entry should replace the previous one, so there will only be one session
recorded at any particular version of this file.  Do *not* change the format of
the first two lines, as the course staff will use automated tools to track the
amount of time students spend on each problem set.

When working in a pair, update the log file for each student with the time that
student spent working in the session.  If a student was not present at a work
session, do not update their work log.
