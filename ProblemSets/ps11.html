      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
      (As always, however, you are encouraged to consult the
      official documentation for the programming language you
      are using, which will be especially relevant to this
      problem set.)
</p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you practice
      with higher-order functions in Java.
</p>
    <p>
      We will test your program using Java 8,
      which is the version of Java installed on CCIS Linux machines.
      You will therefore want to use Java 8 when developing and
      testing your program.
</p>
    <p>
      For these problems, we are giving you the following files:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>Player.java</code>
</li>
      <li>
        <code>RosterWithStream.java</code>
</li>
</ul>
    <p class="strong red">
      <em>You must not change those files in any way.</em>
</p>
    <p>
      Part 1 of this problem set asks you to create
      two more files named
      <code>Players.java</code> and
      <code>RosterWithStreams.java</code>.
      Part 2 asks you to create a
      <code>TestRosterWithStream.java</code> file.
      All of those files must be in the default package.
      In other words, your Java files should not contain any
      <code>package</code> declarations.
</p>
    <p>
      The <code>Player</code> interface we are giving you for
      this problem set is the same as it was in Problem Set 10.
      If your <code>Players.java</code> file from Problem Set 10
      was correct, then you can use it for Problem Set 11.
      If it was incorrect, you'll have to repair it for Problem Set 11.
</p>
    <p>
      You are free to create additional files.
      When we test your submission, we will compile all of the
      Java files in your <code>set11</code> directory using the
      following command:
</p>
    <pre>
      javac *.java
</pre>
    <p>
      You should start by downloading the two files we are giving you,
      unpacking them into a <code>set11</code> directory,
      and pushing that directory to your GitHub repository.
</p>
    <p>
      We are giving you a choice of two formats in which to download
      the files we are giving you.  Both of these links will unpack
      to the same <code>set11</code> directory containing exactly
      the same Java files:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="set11.tgz">
          <code>set11.tgz</code>
</a>
</li>
      <li>
        <a href="set11.zip">
          <code>set11.zip</code>
</a>
</li>
</ul>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
</p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">work session report</a>
      at the end of each work session.
      <span class="red">Be sure to report only the hours
      spent in that work session;
      do <strong><em>not</em></strong> report the cumulative time</span>.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add your work session report
      to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set11</code> directory.
      <strong><em>Do this at the end of every work session.</em></strong>
</p>

    <p>
      This problem set asks you to implement two abstract data types,
      <code>Player</code> and <code>RosterWithStream</code>,
      and to write a <code>main</code> method that tests those data types.
      The <code>Player</code> ADT is the same as in Problem Set 10.
      The <code>RosterWithStream</code> ADT is similar to the
      <code>Roster</code> ADT of Problem Set 10,
      but it adds a <code>stream()</code> method and changes
      the return types of several other methods from
      <code>Roster</code> to <code>RosterWithStream</code>.
      (That is why <code>RosterWithStream</code> cannot just
      extend the <code>Roster</code> interface.)
</p>
    <p>
      To make it easier to consider several similar rosters, the
      <code>RosterWithStream</code> ADT is immutable.
      The <code>Player</code> ADT is mutable, however, because an
      injury, trade, or some other change to a player's status should
      be propagated immediately to all rosters that use the player.
</p>
    <pre>
      // A Player is an object of any class that implements the Player interface.
      //
      // A Player object represents a member of a team.
      // Player objects are mutable because their status can change without
      // changing the identity of the Player.
      // 
      // If p1 and p2 are players, then p1.equals(p2) if and only if
      // p1 and p2 are the same object (i.e. (p1 == p2), p1 and p2
      // have the same name and status, and changing the status of p1
      // necessarily changes the status of p2 in the same way).
      //
      // If p is a player, then p.hashCode() always returns the same
      // value, even after the player's status is changed by calling
      // one of the last three methods listed below.
      //
      // If p1 and p2 are players with distinct names, then
      // p1.toString() is not the same string as p2.toString().
      //
      // Players.make(String name) is a static factory method that returns
      // a player with the given name who is (initially) available.
      
      interface Player {

          //     gw.changeInjuryStatus (true);

          boolean isInjured ();
      
          // Returns true iff this player is suspended.
      
          boolean isSuspended ();

          // to the specified boolean.

        <p>
          For this first part of Problem Set 11, you will define
          a public class named <code>Players</code> in a file named
          <code>Players.java</code> and
          a public class named <code>RosterWithStreams</code> in a file named
          <code>RosterWithStreams.java</code>
</p>
        <p>
          The <code>Players</code> class
          will define a public static factory method
          named <code>make</code> that takes a <code>String</code>
          as its one and only argument and returns a <code>Player</code>
          whose name is the given string.
</p>
        <p>
          The <code>RosterWithStreams</code> class
          will define a public static factory method
          named <code>empty</code> that takes no arguments
          and returns an empty <code>RosterWithStream</code>.
</p>
        <blockquote class="smaller">
          HINT: You will probably find it worth your time to read
          and to understand the
          <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/StreamSupport.html"
             target="_blank">official Java documentation</a> for the
          <code>stream</code> methods of the
          <code>java.util.stream.StreamSupport</code>
          class.
          Those <code>stream</code> methods are static factory methods
          for creating <code>Stream&lt;T&gt;</code> objects.
          You might also benefit from knowing that any class
          that implements the <code>Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface
          (or any interface that extends <code>Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code>)
          automatically defines a default <code>spliterator()</code>
          method that calls the <code>iterator()</code> method
          of that class and uses the <code>Iterator&lt;T&gt;</code>
          result of that call to create
          an analogous <code>Spliterator&lt;T&gt;</code>.
</blockquote>
</li>
      <li>
        (Testing)
        <br />
        <p>
          For this second part of Problem Set 11, you will define
          a public class named
          <code>TestRosterWithStream</code> in a file named
          <code>TestRosterWithStream.java</code>.
          That class will define a public static <code>main</code> method
          that tests the code you wrote in part 1.
</p>
        <p>
          Testing the <code>stream</code> method of the
          <code>RosterWithStream</code> ADT
          ought to involve testing all of the methods supported
          by the <code>Stream&lt;Player&gt;</code> objects
          that will be returned
          by that method.  Some of those methods ought to be
          tested by more than one test.
          (The <code>allMatch</code> and <code>anyMatch</code>
          methods, for example, both ought to be tested in a
          situation for which they return true and in a situation
          for which they return false.)
</p>
        <p>
          That could turn out to be a lot of testing.
          If you write beautiful code for part 1,
          making appropriate use of Java's pre-defined default methods,
          then some of that testing may be less important because any
          mistakes in the default methods will probably have the same
          root causes as mistakes that can be found by testing some of
          the more basic methods.
          Course staff will therefore give special attention to
          the tests you write for the following methods:
</p>
        <pre>
          boolean       allMatch(Predicate&lt;? super T&gt; predicate)
          boolean       anyMatch(Predicate&lt;? super T&gt; predicate)
          long          count()
          Stream&lt;T&gt;     distinct()
          Stream&lt;T&gt;     filter(Predicate&lt;? super T&gt; predicate)
          Optional&lt;T&gt;   findAny()
          Optional&lt;T&gt;   findFirst()
          void          forEach(Consumer&lt;? super T&gt; action)
          &lt;R&gt; Stream&lt;R&gt; map(Function&lt;? super T,? extends R&gt; mapper)
          T             reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator&lt;T&gt; accumulator)
          Stream&lt;T&gt;     skip(long n)
          Object[]      toArray()
