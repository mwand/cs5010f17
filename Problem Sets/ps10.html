<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 10</h1>

<p><strong>Out:</strong> Monday, November 14, 2016
</p>

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, November 28, 2016
at 600pm local time.</p>

<!-- Thu Dec  3 15:01:52 2015: the existing provides are not powerful -->
<!-- enough to test the ball if the ball depends on the factory to -->
<!-- tell it about collisions.   Probably this will have to be -->
<!-- checked manually in the future. -->

<p>Mon Nov 21 13:36:09 2016: See ps10-powerpoint-groups.txt in this directory for
a sketch of a possible replacement for one of these questions.</p>

<p>Wed Nov 30 11:48:16 2016: if we keep cubelets, add an example for
add-teammate. </p>

<hr>

<p>
The goal of this problem set is to give you practice with stateful
classes, and pulling and pushing information. It is also intended to give
you practice with reusing code from previous problem sets.
</p>

<p>Please restrict yourself to the language features discussed in
class. You may use state.  You may not use class inheritance, but you
may use interface inheritance.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the deliverables and instructions for this problem set
are the same as for Problem Set 09.  As always, you must follow the
design recipe, in this case the OO Design Recipe and deliverables as
spelled out in Lesson 9.5 and in <a
href="../Info/deliverables.html#oo-deliverables"
>deliverables.html</a>. Be sure to sync your work and fill out a Work
Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the

<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/HkmxyskLqYPVGMw23" >Work Session Report for PS
10</a>.</p> </p>

<p>As with ps09,  you may submit your solution
in multiple files. See details below. </p>

<ol>
  <li> Your boss at the toy factory has been taking PDP, and he has
  been persuaded to buy a "framework" from WidgetWorks International.
  The salesman told him that the WidgetWorks framework eliminates the
  need for your developers to deal with big-bang.  You, of course,
  know that's not so hard, but your boss, still hungover from his
  party, is pretty gullible.

  The salesman explains that with WidgetWorks, call you do is create
  a WidgetWorks Container(TM), load it up with your widgets and
  swidgets, and send it a 'run' message.  You can even add additional
  widgets and swidgets while it's running.

  Your boss is convinced, and tells you to reimplement your Metatoy
  using the WidgetWorks framework.

  The framework is delivered as a file called <a href="WidgetWorks.rkt"
  >WidgetWorks.rkt</a> that provides three interfaces and one
  function, as follows:

  <pre>
;;; Function:

;; container-init : NonNegInt NonNegInt -> Container
;; GIVEN: the width and height of a canvas
;; RETURNS: a Container, initially empty, but which, when run, will
;; create a canvas of the given width and height and which will send events
;; to the Widgets and SWidgets that are added to it.

;;; Interfaces:

;; A Container is an object of any class that implements Container<%>

(define Container<%>
  (interface ()

   ; Widget -> Void
   ; GIVEN: A widget
   ; EFFECT: adds the given widget to this container
   add-widget

   ; SWidget -> Void
   ; GIVEN: A stateful widget
   ; EFFECT: adds the given swidget to this container
   add-stateful-widget

   ; PosReal -> Void
   ; GIVEN: a framerate, in secs/tick
   ; EFFECT: runs the widgets and stateful widgets in this framework
   ; at the given framerate.
   run

    ))

;; A Widget is an object of any class that implements Widget<%>

(define Widget<%>
  (interface ()

    ; -> Widget
    ; GIVEN: no arguments
    ; RETURNS: the state of this object that should follow at time t+1.
    after-tick          

    ; Integer Integer -> Widget
    ; GIVEN: a location
    ; RETURNS: the state of this object that should follow the
    ; specified mouse event at the given location.
    after-button-down
    after-button-up
    after-drag
    after-move

    ; KeyEvent -> Widget
    ; GIVEN: a key event and a time
    ; RETURNS: the state of this object that should follow the
    ; given key event
    after-key-event     

    ; Scene -> Scene
    ; GIVEN: a scene
    ; RETURNS: a scene like the given one, but with this object
    ; painted on it.
    add-to-scene
    ))

;; An SWidget is an object of any class that implements the SWidget<%>
;; interface.

;; A SWidget is like a Widget, but it is stable (stateful).

(define SWidget<%>
  (interface ()

    ; -> Void
    ; GIVEN: no arguments
    ; EFFECT: updates this widget to the state it should have
    ; following a tick.
    after-tick          

    ; Integer Integer -> Void
    ; GIVEN: a location
    ; EFFECT: updates this widget to the state it should have
    ; following the specified mouse event at the given location.
    after-button-down
    after-button-up
    after-drag
    after-move

    ; KeyEvent -> Void
    ; GIVEN: a key event
    ; EFFECT: updates this widget to the state it should have
    ; following the given key event
    after-key-event     

    ; Scene -> Scene
    ; GIVEN: a scene
    ; RETURNS: a scene like the given one, but with this object
    ; painted on it.
    add-to-scene
    ))
</pre>

<p>You are relieved to see that these interfaces are much like the
ones you've been working with.  Just as the salesman said, you run
your widgets and swidgets by creating a Container, adding your widgets
and swidgets to it, and then calling the <kbd>run</kbd> method on your
container.  You no longer need to call big-bang yourself.</p>

<p>Your job is to reimplement the toy from problem set 9, but using
the WidgetWorks framework and stateful objects. The specifications and
deliverables are exactly the same, except that:

<ul>

  <li><kbd>Metatoy<%></kbd> inherits from
  <kbd>SWidget<%></kbd> instead of <kbd>World<%></kbd>.</li>

  <li><kbd>Toy<%></kbd> inherits from <kbd>SWidget<%></kbd> instead of
  <kbd>Widget<%></kbd>.  Also, <kbd>after-move</kbd> is removed from
  <kbd>Toy<%></kbd> and added to <kbd>SWidget<%></kbd> where it more
  properly belongs.</li>
  

  <!-- <li> <kbd> Toy&lt;%&gt;</kbd> inherits from <kbd> -->
  <!-- SWidget&lt;%&gt;</kbd> instead of -->
  <!-- <kbd>Widget&lt;%&gt;</kbd>.</li> -->

  <!-- <li>Since WidgetWorks has comandeered the <kbd>make-world</kbd> function, you -->
  <!-- should provide a function called <kbd>make-playground</kbd> -->
  <!-- instead.</li> -->

  <li>The specification for the <kbd>run</kbd> function that you
  provide is now

  <pre>
run : PosNum -> Void
GIVEN: a frame rate (in seconds/tick)
EFFECT: This function creates a Container, and places a MetaToy with
no toys in that Container.  The function may or may not put other
Widgets and SWidgets in the container, depending on the
implementation. The function then runs the Container at the given
frame rate using WidgetWorks.
</pre>

 Note that this change relaxes the previous
  contract, since now any value is acceptable as a return value from
  <kbd>run</kbd>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Turn in your solution as a file named "q1.rkt". Put a copy of <a
  href="WidgetWorks.rkt" >WidgetWorks.rkt</a> in the directory with
  your solution.  YOU MAY NOT MODIFY WidgetWorks.rkt IN ANY WAY.  WE
  MAY TEST YOUR SOLUTION WITH OUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION OF
<kbd>Container<%></kbd>. </p>

<p><span class="strike">Hint: in the Week 10 examples, each SBall took the wall as one of
its init-fields, and registered itself with the wall during its
initialization.  The contracts in ps09 rule out an analogous
"self-registration" strategy here.  So you will have to make the
object that creates the toys subscribe each toy to the relevant
notification or notifications. Be sure you can explain your
registration strategy at codewalk. If this hint is mysterious when you
read it, check back when you try to implement
<kbd>make-throbber</kbd>, etc.</span>  <span class="new"><strong>ADDED
MON 11/21/16:</strong>  Now that I look at it, I think this hint is
more misleading than helpful.  So you can safely ignore it.  See
@1044.  Sorry about that. -Prof. Wand</span></p>


  </li>

  <li> Your boss at the toy factory asks you to produce a new toy
  inspired by <a
  href="http://www.modrobotics.com/cubelets/" >Cubelets</a>, which are
  square blocks that stick together.  The new toy has the following specification:  

  <ol><p/>

    <li>The toy consists of a canvas that is 600 pixels wide and 500
    pixels high.</li>

    <li>When the child types "b", a new block pops up on the screen
    at the location of the last button-down or button-up.  The block appears as a 20x20
    outline square.  The square is initially green.  If the child
    types a "b" before the first button-down or button-up event, then
    the first block appears in an unspecified but fixed place on the canvas.</li>

    <li>A block does not move by itself, but the child can move it
    around using Smooth Drag.  When the block is selected, it appears
    as red rather than green.</li>

    <li>If a block is dragged so that it contacts or overlaps another
    block, the two blocks become connected.  We say that the blocks
    are <em>teammates.</em>.  The property of being a teammate is
    symmetric and transitive.  So if block A is moved to touch block
    B, then a new team is formed consisting of A and all its
    teammates, and B and all its teammates.</li>

    <li>Two blocks overlap if they intersect at any point.  For this
    purpose, the edges of the block are considered part of the
    block.</li>

    <li>Once two blocks become teammates, they remain teammates forever.</li>

    <li>When a block is moved, all its teammates move along with it.
    If A and B are teammates, and A is dragged in some direction, then
    B moves the same way.</li>

    <li>Only the selected block accumulates teammates.  If A is being
    dragged, and B is a teammate of A, and A's motion causes B to come
    into contact with C, C does not become a teammate of A and B.  In
    the video below, we call the selected block the "leader."  But you
    can drag a team by selecting any block in the team, so the leader
    may be different on different drags.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>Here's a demonstration:</p>

    <p><center>
<video src="Videos/10-teammates.mp4" controls />
</center>
</p>



  <p>Your solution should be a file named <kbd>q2.rkt</kbd> that
  provides the following two functions and one interface:</p>

  <pre>
cubelets-init : -> Container
GIVEN: no arguments
RETURNS: a Container, initially with no blocks, which when run, will
run in a 600x500 canvas and process the events in the description above.

make-block : NonNegInt NonNegInt ListOfSBlock -> SBlock
GIVEN: an x and y position, and a list of blocks
WHERE: the list of blocks is the list of blocks already on the playground.
RETURNS: a new block, at the given position, with no teammates
NOTE: it is up to you as to whether you use the third argument or
not.  Some implementations may use the third argument; others may not.

You must provide an interface named SBlock<%>.  Your SBlock<%>
interface should inherit from the SWidget<%> interface and add AT
LEAST the following methods:

get-team : -> ListOfSBlock
RETURNS: the teammates of this sblock

add-teammate: SBlock -> Void
EFFECT: adds the given sblock to this block's team

sblock-x : -> Integer
sblock-y : -> Integer
RETURNS: the x or y coordinates of this sblock</span>
</pre>

<p>You may put more methods in the <kbd>SBlock<%></kbd> interface if
you so desire.  Remember that a method must appear in the interface if
and only if it is called from outside this object.</p>

  <p>There are several places where information must be disseminated in
this problem, either by pushing or pulling.  Be prepared to identify
these and to discuss your design decisions about each of them.</p>

  <p>As in the problem above, you must use WidgetWorks.rkt .</p>

</li>
</ol>

<strong>DELIVERING YOUR SOLUTION IN MULTIPLE FILES:</strong> As you've
no doubt noticed, your programs have become longer, and it is awkward
to navigate to a particular definition.  So you may split your
solution over multiple files if you so desire.  Here are some ground
rules:

<ul>

  <li>All of the files for both questions must live in the same
  directory, as usual.</li>

  <li>Your directory must include a copy of WidgetWorks.rkt and
  extras.rkt .</li>

  <li>Running the file q1.rkt or q2.rkt should load the solution to
  each question.  As in the past, loading this file should not run the
  interactive system.  You'll need to include in each of
  these files a function (typically called 'run' or similar) that
  actually runs the code interactively.  Be sure to include
  instructions near the top of your file so the TA can run your system
  visually.</li>

  <li>You may organize your files in any way that is coherent.  You
  will need to defend your organization at codewalk.  However, we
  recommend an organization like the following:<p/>

  <ul>

    <li>A file named something like interfaces.rkt that contains your
    interfaces, constants, and other data that is needed by multiple
    classes.  </li>

    <li>A file for each class, incuding the unit tests for that
    class.</li>

    <li>A top-level file, named q1.rkt or q2.rkt, that
    requires the other files and provides the deliverable functions
    and classes listed with each question.</li>

  </ul>

</li>

</ul>
