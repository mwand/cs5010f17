    <h3>
      Static Factory Method Pattern
    </h3>
    <p>
      Although Java's <code>new C(...)</code> syntax for creating
      new objects is straightforward, it causes
      problems when used indiscriminately in large programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Java, that syntax requires
      the creating method to know the name of the class for that
      new object.
      That may sound reasonable for simple data types such as
      <code>UTC</code>, but what if there are two or more classes
      that implement the <code>UTC</code> interface?
      What if choosing which class to use is complicated?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the classes that implements the <code>UTC</code>
      interface might be preferred during the early phases of
      a program's execution, but a different representation
      might be preferred during later phases.
      If users of the <code>UTC</code> abstract data type
      create new values of that type using the
      <code>new</code> operator, then every use
      of that operator would need to be augmented by conditional
      code that determines the current phase of the program
      before deciding whether to create the new value via
      <code>new UTC1(...)</code> or <code>new UTC2(...)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give another example, suppose it becomes necessary to
      improve the efficiency of a program, and someone concludes
      its efficiency could be improved by creating at most one
      <code>UTC</code> object for any given combination of hour
      and minute.  Then every occurrence of <code>new UTC1(h,m)</code>
      would have to be replaced by a fairly complicated computation
      that determines whether a <code>UTC</code> with hour and
      minute components equal to <code>h</code> and <code>m</code>
      is already available.  If so, it would use that previously created
      <code>UTC</code>.  If not, it would create a new <code>UTC</code>
      and enter that new <code>UTC</code> into a database of
      available <code>UTC</code> values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The computations implied by those two examples are too
      complicated to be written out in full everywhere a new
      <code>UTC</code> value is needed.
      Writing those computations out in many different places
      would violate the programming principle that says
      <em>Don't repeat yourself.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Static factory methods</em> solve the problem.
      Instead of writing out the logic needed to decide
      whether it is necessary to create a brand new object,
      and to decide which representation to use for that object
      if a new object is needed,
      we can define a single static factory method that
      encapsulates the necessary logic.  Everyone who needs to
      create new values of that data type can then call the
      static factory method instead of writing code that
      contains explicit uses of the <code>new</code> syntax.
