  <h3>
    Interfaces in Java
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      In Java, every interface goes into a separate file,
      and those files should not contain anything except
      the interface definition and its comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of that file must be the name of the interface
      followed by the <code>.java</code> suffix, which indicates
      the file contains Java source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      For simplicity, we will put all of a program's
      <code>*.java</code> files into a single directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The Java system we will be using in this course
      requires a program's directory structure to be the same
      as its package structure.
      Putting all of a program's files into a single directory
      therefore implies we will be putting all of the program's
      code into the default package,
      which means you won't have to learn about Java packages.)
