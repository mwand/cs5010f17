      Equality: What a Concept
    </h3>
    <p>
      Equality sounds like a simple concept:
      Two things are equal if and only if they're the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what does it mean for two things to be the same?
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine yourself writing a string matching function
      to be used in some search engine.
      Which of the following strings should your function
      regard as the same?
    </p>
    <pre>
      Kurt Goedel
      kurt gödel
      KURT GÖDEL
      Kurt Gödel
      Kurt Gödel
    </pre>
    <p>
      For the purpose of matching strings in a search engine,
      you might want to ignore the differences between upper
      and lower case letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      You almost certainly want to ignore the differences between
      the last two strings above.
      Chances are, you can't even see any difference between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next-to-last string, "Kurt Gödel", is represented in
      Unicode's normalization form NFC, and occupies 12 bytes
      in the UTF-8 format used by this web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last string, "Kurt Gödel", is represented in
      Unicode's normalization form NFD, and occupies 13 bytes
      in the UTF-8 format used by this web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ignore case when comparing strings in Scheme or Java,
      you can use the
      <code>string-ci=?</code> function or
      <code>equalsIgnoreCase</code> method instead of
      <code>string=?</code> or
      <code>equals</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To compare strings while ignoring differences between the
      various ways to represent a string in Unicode, you should
      convert both strings to a common normalization form before
      comparing them.
