    <p>
      Objects of <code>Class2</code> and <code>Class3</code>
      are built the same way and give the same answer for every
      method call.
      Any program that works with objects defined by one definition
      would work the same way with objects defined by the other
      definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is another reason we write contracts in terms of interfaces,
      not classes.
      If we wrote contracts in terms of classes,
      the program would be tied to the name and definition of that class,
      and wouldn't work with objects of another class even though they
      behave exactly the same as objects of the class named in the contract.
