    <p>
      This lesson introduces static methods in Java and similar languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The methods we have seen in previous lessons are associated
      with objects, and are called dynamic methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Static methods are not associated with objects.
      In Java, static methods are associated with classes.
      Static methods are just functions that happen to be
      defined within a class instead of being defined at
      the top level of a file as in Racket's
      Beginning Student Language.
