    <p>
      As can be seen from the four benchmarks that have been
      presented, there is no simple answer to the question of
      whether garbage collection performs better or worse
      than explicit deallocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people are addicted to simple answers, however,
      especially when those answers are rooted in long-standing
      prejudice or tribal identity.

      Programmers are people.
      Many programmers take pride in their knowledge and skillful
      use of the programming language they know best.
      When confronted with empirical evidence showing their
      favorite language does not always perform as well as
      other languages, they may become defensive and resort
      to special pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
